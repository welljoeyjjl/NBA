## React JS based NBA Player Strength Visualization

• Created a dashboard using React, D3 and Ant Design backed by API from stats.nba.com to visualize individual
player’s shot data, including a shot chart and user profile view.

• Created 4 extra filters and 2 shot themes (hexbin and scatter) to provide more customized visualization on the
shotchart.

• Developed a autocomplete player search bar providing a list of players (image and name) in the suggestion list.
